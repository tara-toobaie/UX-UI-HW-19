            <div class="contain"><h1>Hi, I am <span class="coloryallow" >Tara Toobaie</span>, a UX/UI Designer.
<br>I believe that life is about learning and improving and design is not excluded from this rule. As a designer I learned to have this mindset regardless of where am I in my career.<br>
I am a curious, self-driven product designer with industrial design and fine art background who is passionate to build ideas for future and emerging technologies, and deliver them by interaction design. My strong sense of empathy and helping people make me to build engaging experience with intuitive architectures that leave user with unique, impactful and efficient experience.
